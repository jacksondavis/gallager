Gallager
=======
This is a Gallaga-esque game I created as a final project for my Computer Science II course. 

## Overview
What began as a simple Gallaga clone spawned into something much more original. 

This is a project that I created shortly after being introduced to the basics of Object-Oriented Progamming. Looking back, there are several ways which I would have changed the structure of this program, however, what is there works and is the most ambitious, largest program I have written to date.

Early on in the project, I chose to use an old pixelated image of my Computer Science I professor as a temporary avatar, however after encouragement from my peers I decided to continue with the theme. This led to me drawing a cyborg version of my CSII professor to be used as a boss character and adding a few other inside references, seen in soundbytes and another professor being Player Two.

All images and sounds were created by me, and working on this program gave me a chance to combine many fundamental programming concepts as well as my side hobby of music composition to complete this entertaining project. 

To run, clone repository and run the rungame.sh file

##Controls 
Player 1:
WASD or Up/Down/Left/Right - Move
Space - Shoot

Player 2:
Numpad - Move
Numpad7 - Shoot

##To Do
I am happy with the way this game turned out, however it would be a good challenge to come back to this in the future using the current experience I have now. Changing the way that many of the animations are structured, as well as relying on a sprite sheet rather than a number of images would be simple changes which would clean up the flow of the program.
